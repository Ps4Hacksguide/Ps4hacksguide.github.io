## Running the site locally

This requires the following installed on your system:
- node.js

To test the website locally, clone the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Xziip/Guide_Vita --recurse-submodules
cd Guide_Vita
```

Then simply run the following commands:

```sh
npm ci
npm run docs:dev
```

The website should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5173/ (or a port shown on the terminal).
